If you're new to the Kubernetes community and looking for a place to contribute,
it can be challenging to figure out how to get started.  New contributors should
join us for one of the New Contributor Orientation sessions, held once a month
on Zoom.

**Meeting Time**: every 3rd Tuesday of the month for 1 hour
